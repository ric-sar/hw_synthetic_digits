The aim of this homework is to understand and build FCNs models using PyTorch. The dataset used contains 12,000 synthetically generated images of English digits embedded on random backgrounds (randomly selected from a subset of COCO dataset).<br />Images are generated with varying fonts, colors, scales and rotations.

This dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/synthetic-digits) as a benchmark of the work on [Effects of Degradations on Deep Neural Network Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10108) - [GitHub](https://github.com/prasunroy/cnn-on-degraded-images)
